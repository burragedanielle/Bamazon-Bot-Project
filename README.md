## About Bamazon 

Bamazon is inspired from Amazon, where customers can shop a variety of random products on an interactive storefront. Bamazon uses MySQL to keep track of product inventory, IDs and allows customers to "purchase" products (disclaimer: no real products will come to your house, please don't sue.) Bamazon takes orders, depletes stock, and updates a customer's cart.

## Room for Growth :seedling:
- Adding more complex checkout stage for Customers where they are asked if they'd like to checkout, if they'd like to delete products, etc. 
- Working on Manager view of Bamazon where you can add, delete and view inventory via CLI
